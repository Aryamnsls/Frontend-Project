After signing in, click on the "+" icon to create a new project.
Choose "Blank" to start with an empty canvas.
Step 2: Design the Layout
Create Frames:

Use the "Frame" tool to create frames for different sections of your website (e.g., header, footer, main content).
Set frame sizes based on common screen dimensions.
Add Elements:

Use shapes, text, and other elements to design the layout of your website.
Create navigation menus, headers, and other structural components.
Import Assets:

Import images or icons that you want to use in your design.
Step 3: Design the UI Components
Style Components:

Customize the appearance of buttons, input fields, and other UI components.
Experiment with colors, fonts, and other styling options.
Create Reusable Components:

Use Figma's "Components" feature to create reusable design elements (e.g., buttons, cards).
Step 4: Add Interactivity
Create Prototypes:
Use the "Prototype" mode to add links and interactions between frames.
Define transitions, hover effects, and navigation paths.
Step 5: Share and Collaborate

Click on the "Share" button to generate a shareable link.
Share the link with collaborators or stakeholders for feedback.
Collaborate:

Continue refining the design until it meets the project requirements.
Step 7: Handoff to Developers
